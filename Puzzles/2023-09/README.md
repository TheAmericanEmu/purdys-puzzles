If you use ASCII to convert "Hornets" to binary, you get

`01001000 01101111 01110010 01101110 01100101 01110100 01110011`

which has exactly 30 1's

Including the punctuation, capitalization shown, and new line characters,
how many 1s are in the binary representation of the Flour Bluff High School school song?

```
Dear Ole Flour Bluff High School,
We pay you honor today.
We will tell the world that your honor will stay.
All hail to those who came before us,
And made us so strong.
We will never falter or DO YOU WRONG.
```
