Most people are familiar with square numbers (`n*n`): 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...

Fewer people are familiar with pentagonal numbers (`3n(n-1)/2`): 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...

Few people have heard of octagonal numbers (`n(3n-2)`): 1, 8, 21, 40, 65, ...

176 is the 8th octagonal number and the first pentagonal number greater than 1 that is also octagonal.

1 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 22.  We will call this the "star" value of the number.

The star value of the 2nd pentagonal number greater than 1 that is also octagonal is 43.

What is the star value of the 5th pentagonal number greater than 1 that is also octagonal?
