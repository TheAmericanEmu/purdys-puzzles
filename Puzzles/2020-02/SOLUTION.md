# February 2020 Puzzle Solution

## Understanding the problem

By definition:

```
The aliquot parts of a number are the proper divisors of that number that are less than the number.  
```

So we need to start by finding the proper divisors of a number.  This can be done using a loop:

```
for each number less than n:
    if n mod number is 0, it is an aliquot part
```

You would then need to keep track of the aliquot parts of a number to add them up.  You might keep track of these sums in a list or maybe even a dictionary.

After getting a list of equivalent numbers, you must find the pair with the largest difference between them.  

Here is [my solution](./solutions/equivalent.py).  Interestingly, a few of the student solutions below are faster than mine, so be sure to take a look at them as well!
