i know you thought you were almost done, but that wasn't actually the puzzle.  if you haven't figured it out yet, you should look really closely at your keyboard.  by the time you got to this point in the message, i hope you realized what you need to do.  if you're using java, consider using a hashmap.  if you're using python, try out a dictionary.  in javascript, it's just a plain old object.  i wouldn't recommend doing all of this by hand! this sentence looks like it might be a puestion, doesn't it? but yea, it wasn't, was it?  at this point you're probably wondering, "what is the point of all of this?"  well, to be honest, i put a bunch of extra puestion marks in the message just to throw you off.  at some point this gets so long that it really feels like i'm just trying to make you write a program. well, i am.  if you've gotten this far by hand, you must really have a lot of free time.  with all of that free time, you could easily learn what you need to write a program to decode this message.  when i finally ask the puestion for this month, you're going to be so surprised.  in the meantime, how about some song lyrics? mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb.  row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream.  if you're happy and you know it, clap your hands!  twinkle twinkle little star, how i wonder what you are, up above the world so high, like a diamond in the sky.  all around the mulberry bush, the monkey chased the weasel. why aren't there any thanksgiving songs?  that wasn't the puestion for the puzzle, just an observation. the puestion i want an answer to does not have a puestion mark.  come and tell me where the pilgrims stood after landing on plymouth rock.  keep in mind that i am a dad, so the 
answer to the puestion should reflect that.  if you still aren't sure, you should ask your dad, or anyone's dad for that matter, and i bet they can 
tell you.  good luck.
