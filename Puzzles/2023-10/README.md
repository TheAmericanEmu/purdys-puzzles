## Why is Six afraid of Seven?  Because Seven ate Nine!

We will call a positive integer **"spooky"** if the sum of its cubed digits is 789.

The first spooky number is `3558` since `3^3 + 5^3 + 5^3 + 8^3 = 789`

There are 12 spooky numbers under 10,000 and the product of their non-zero digits is `2.176782336x10^33`.  This product mod 1031 is `245`.

### What is the product of all of the non-zero digits of all of the spooky numbers that are under 10,000,000, mod 1031?
